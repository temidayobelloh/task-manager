 build a "Task Manager" application using React. This is a practical project that involves creating, updating, and deleting tasks. Here's a basic outline of features:
 
### Task Manager App
 
#### Features:
 
1. **Task List:**

   - Display a list of tasks with details like task name, description, and due date.

   - Each task should have options to mark it as complete or delete it.
 
2. **Add Task:**

   - Allow users to add a new task with a name, description, and due date.

   - Validate and handle empty task names or past due dates.
 
3. **Edit Task:**

   - Enable users to edit task details after creation.
 
4. **Complete Task:**

   - Allow users to mark a task as complete, visually differentiating it from incomplete tasks.
 
5. **Delete Task:**

   - Provide the option to delete a task.
 
#### Technical Implementation:
 
1. **Create React App:**

   - Set up a new React project using Create React App for a quick start.
 
2. **Component Structure:**

   - Create components for TaskList, TaskItem, AddTaskForm, EditTaskForm, etc.
 
3. **State Management:**

   - Use React state to manage the list of tasks and their statuses (complete or incomplete).
 
4. **Form Handling:**

   - Implement forms for adding and editing tasks. Utilize controlled components to handle form input.
 
5. **Styling:**

   - Apply basic styling using CSS or a styling library like styled-components to make the app visually appealing.
 
6. **LocalStorage:**

   - Implement local storage to persist tasks even after a page refresh.
 
7. **Routing (Optional):**

   - Use React Router for handling different views like the task list and task details.
 
8. **Date Handling:**

   - Consider using a date library or built-in JavaScript Date object to handle due dates effectively.
 
9. **Responsive Design (Optional):**

   - Make the application responsive for various screen sizes.
 
 
This project will not only help you practice React fundamentals but also provide a practical understanding of state management, form handling, and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a web application.
